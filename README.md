# AliceHolt - Preschool / Early Years
## Project Brief
Over the past few years, Alice Holt Forest has hosted a Julia
Donaldson trail that runs all year long. Visitors can buy a trail pack
at the visitor centre, filled with fun activities for kids to enjoy
while exploring the trail. In 2023, the Zog trail introduced a free
app called “Zog: A Forest Adventure,” which added an interactive
element, allowing children to collect golden stars as they
journeyed through the forest. The app also featured exciting bonus
activities like a roar-ometer, a dance challenge, and the
opportunity to transform into Zog. We believe that a VR experience
aimed at families with young children would attract a great deal of
engagement.
